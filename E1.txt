Aim: Introduction to the Node.js and its installation to print Hello World

Software Used: OS: Ubuntu, Node.js, npm.

Theory:
Node.js (Node) is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Node is used extensively for server-side programming, making it possible for developers to use JavaScript for client-side and server-side code without needing to learn an additional language. Node is sometimes referred to as a programming language or software development framework, but neither is true; it is strictly a JavaScript runtime.

To install Node.js on ubuntu.
1. Open the ‘Terminal’.
2. Type the command sudo apt install nodejs (Hit the Enter)
3. To check the installed version of nodejs, type the command 
node –v (Hit the Enter)

To install npm
1. Open the ’Terminal’
2. Type the command sudo apt install npm (Hit the Enter)
3. To check the installed version of npm, type the command 
npm –v (Hit the Enter)

To start the Node.js
1. Open the ‘Terminal’.
2. Type node (Hit the Enter)

To write and execute the first program on Node.js
1. Create a text file. Save it with the name P1.js

2. Type the following code-
console.log(“Hello World”);

3. To run the program, open the ‘Terminal’.
4. Change the path to the current folder.
5. Type the command node P1.js (Hit the Enter)

Conclusion: Thus we have completed the installation of Nodejs while printing the output.
